In this problem, you must first complete a simple stack class, which has some functions such as push, pop, top and so on.

Please finish the stack.cpp file.

 

In the meanwhile, as an improved task, you can think about how to do error checking and overflow prevention in this stack class.  

After that you need to achieve match.h class that has only one member function isMatch, used to detect brackets match. 

 

About bracket matching, we restrict attention to "{}", "()" and "[]".

For example, the string {([])} is a match, because the brackets in the correct position and correspondence.

However even though the string {[(])} has the same number of opening and closing brackets, the [] and () do not correspond, so this is not a match. 

Please finish the function isMatch, and return your result: true or false.
