With a class "Student" declared as below:

 class Student {

public:
  int id;
  char name[50]; // Data field
  int age; // Data field
  Student();
  Student(int, const char*, int);
};
 
You are required to implement the class functions and also two other functions used to process Student objects, which can get output as specified later.
 
void set(Student* , int, const char*, int);
void print(Student);
 
You don't need to submit the main function.

With a main function as below:

 int main(){

  Student std1, std2(123, "John Smith", 18), std3(124);
  set(std1, 100, "Bill Gates", 61);
  print(std1);
  print(std2);
  print(std3);
  return 0;
}
the following output should be printed with the implementations added by you:

Bill Gates (100) is 61 years old.
John Smith (123) is 18 years old.
No Name (124) is 0 years old.
