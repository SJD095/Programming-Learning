In this exercise, you are required to implement a class named OstreamIterator and a function which copies the elements of a vector to the class.

The class OstreamIterator mainly acts as an Iterator of a ostream(here it is cout), but it is a bit different.Because here the cout will output a int number and a delimeter(分隔符)every time.The int number is from the vector which is copied to the class by the function CopyIterator.

The header of the class and the prototype of the function are given below.And the sample input and output are as followed.

Sample Input

7

1 2 3 4 56 78 12

Sample Output

1,2,3,4,56,78,12,
