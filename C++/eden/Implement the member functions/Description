Design each of the member functions of the class STUDENT, whose interface is described in student.h

 


Hint:

Pay attention to static

// function displayGrades definition
void Student::displayGrades() const {
    cout << "Here are the grades for " << name << endl;
    // output each grade
    for ( int i = 0; i < numGrades; i++ )
       cout << setw(5) << grades[i];
    cout << endl << endl;
}   // end function displayGrades
