All of you have known about deep copy. In this problem, there are two classes Base and Derived. The Base Class has a value field and Derived Class which inherits from Base has a data(pointer) field and size field itself. Base Class has been given to you, please Implements the Derived Class in "derived.cpp". 

To avoid pesentation error in your code,  the implementation of std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Derived&)  has also been given to you in "main.cpp".

 

===================
Sample Test

int* arr = new int[10];
int b[4] = {4, 1, 4, 2};
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    arr[i] = i;
Derived d1(arr, 10, 4);
cout << d1 << endl;
Derived d2(d1);
cout << d2 << endl;

Derived d3(b, 4, 5);
cout << d3 << endl;

d2 = d3;
cout << d2 << endl;
delete []arr;

====================
Sample Output

Derived Datas: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Base Value: 4
Derived Datas: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Base Value: 5
Derived Datas: 4 1 4 2
Base Value: 5
