XiaoMing is so bored! He has installed a dual system and decide to play games on Windows and study on Linux.
There are two abstract class System and Activity.
Class Windows and class Linux are the derived classes of class System.
Class Game and class Study are the derived classes of class Activity.
 
Please implement the four derived classes according to function main.
 
tip:
1. class System has a pure virtual function info(). This function will renturn the information of its system in derived class.Windows system returns "Windows QAQ"，Linux system renturns "Linux T_T"
2. class Activity has a data system_ which shows the system of activity and a data name which shows the active person
3.class Activityhas a pure virtual function play(). This function will renturn a string of all information in derived class. Such as "TA is playing game on Windows QAQ" and "xiaoming is studying on Linux T_T"
 
中文题面：
小明闲着没事装了双系统，windows和linux，他很蛋疼地决定要在windows下玩游戏，在linux下敲代码。

现在，有两个抽象类System和Activity，System的子类是Windows和Linux，Activity的子类是Game和Study。
System有纯虚函数info()，子类的实现返回当前系统的信息。Windows返回"Windows QAQ"，Linux返回"Linux T_T"
Activity的system_成员表示当前活动所在平台，name成员表示活动进行的人的名字
Activity的纯虚函数play()在子类实现返回一个字符串表示某人正在进行的活动和平台。形如“TA is playing game on Windows QAQ”和 “xiaoming is studying on Linux T_T”
 
Input

a b
 
Output


a is studying on Linux T_T
a is studying on Windows QAQ
b is playing game on Windows QAQ
b is playing game on Linux T_T
