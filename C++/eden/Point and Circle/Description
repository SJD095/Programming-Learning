We know a point (x,y) has  x coordinate and y coordinate and a circle has a center and a radius.

There is a base class Point, and a derived class Circle.

Please implement all the classes according to the function main.

 

tips:

Class Point:

a)function print(): a point(2,3) will print "This Point is [2, 3]\n"

 

Class Circle:

a) #define PI 3.14159

b) radius >= 0

c)function area(): calculate the area of a circle

d)function print(): a circle has a center(2,3) and radius 6 will print "The center of Circle is [2, 3]\n" and "The radius of Circle is 6\n"

 

Intput：

3 4

4 6 2

 

Output：


3
4
This Point is [3, 4]
4
6
2
12.5664
The center of Circle is [4, 6]
The radius of Circle is 2
