Write a program to input some miles m(0 < m <= 1000) and output the corresponding kilometers like the the following table:


Miles        Kilometers     
1              1.609          
2              3.218          
3              4.827          
4              6.436          
5              8.045          
6              9.654          
7              11.263         
8              12.872         
9              14.481         
10            16.090        

 

Note that 1 mile is 1.609 kilometers.

There are several test cases. For each test case, the first line is the number of the miles n(0 < n <= 100).

The following lines are the miles m and each of them is in one line.

Output
 
Miles        Kilometers     
1              1.609          
2              3.218          
3              4.827  
Note: You should specifies the width of each column to 15, set the precision of a floating-point number to 3, and justify the output to the left.
