Description

Known the coordinates of  two points are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), calculate the distance between two points on the plane.

Input

The first line of the input data is an integer t, represents the number of test data sets, then t rows, each row consists of four real numbers,x1, y1, x2, y2,separated by spaces. Wherein 0≤x1, y1, x2, y2≤500。

Output

The results retain four decimal places. A separate line for each output, the occupancy of each result was 16, align right, and complement spare parts  with the "*".
