Here comes counters again XD.

This time counters don't share data any more. And each counter must be able to do the both job: counting and counting back.

The way you control them is by using operator++(for counting) and operator--(for counting back).

For example, once you announc a counter:

counter2 c;
Then you are able to use these four operators:

++c;
c++;
--c;
c--;
The 3 public method is also required: set, reset, and show.
