Create a SavingsAccount class. Use a static data member to store the annualInterestRate to store the
annual interest rate for each of the savers. Each member of the class contains a private data member savingsBalance
indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide a member function calculateMonthlyInterest
member function that calculates the monthly interest by multiplying the balance by
annualInterestRate divided by 12; this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static
member function modifyInterestRate that sets the static annualInterestRate to a new value. If the new value is invalid,

set the annualInterestRate to 3 percent.
