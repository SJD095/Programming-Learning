This is an easy question. Try to use adaptable functors and fucntion adapters in algorithm library instead of the for, while, do while statement.

 

If arr1[] = {1,2,1,2,1,2}, arr2[] = {1,2,3,1,2,3}, 

gr8 should be a vector with elements of 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

m8 should be a vector with elements of 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

sum should be a vector with elements of 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 5.

prod should be a vector with elements of 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0.
