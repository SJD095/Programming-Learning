Write a program that accomplishes each of the following:
a) Create a user-defined class Complex that contains the private integer data members real and imaginary
and declares stream insertion and stream extraction overloaded operator functions as friends of the
class.
b) Define the stream insertion and stream extraction operator functions. The stream extraction operator
function should determine whether the data entered is valid, and, if not, it should set failbit to indicate
improper input. The input should be of the form "a + bi", "a - bi", or just "a", "bi"(without quotes).

Note that although b=1, b can't be omitted.
c) The values can be negative or positive, and it is possible that one of the two values is not provided. If a
value is not provided, the appropriate data member should be set to 0. The stream-insertion operator
should not be able to display the complex number if an input error occurred. For negative imaginary
values, a minus sign should be printed rather than a plus sign.

Sample Input

2 + 2i

 

Sample Output

Complex number entered was:

2+2i
