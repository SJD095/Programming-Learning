Now you have to implement a class named ExpandedVector, with only one method my_reverse.

This method simply reverse the order of elements in the sequence of a vector.

For example:

v.push_back(1);    // 1

v.push_back(2);    // 1 2

v.my_reverse();    // 2 1

For your convenience, the data type of the elements is set to be ints.
